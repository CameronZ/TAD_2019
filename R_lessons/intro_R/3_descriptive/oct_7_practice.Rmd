# Descriptive practice


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE
)
```
 
1. Write two sentences. Save each as a seperate object in R. 

```{r message=FALSE}

require(quanteda)

```

2. Combine them into a corpus

```{r message=FALSE}

```

3. Make this corpus into a dfm with all pre-processing options at their defaults.

```{r message=FALSE}

```

4. Now save a second dfm, this time with stopwords removed.

```{r message=FALSE}

```


5. Calculate the TTR for each of these dfms (use textstat_lexdiv). Which is higher?

```{r message=FALSE}

```



5. Calculate the Manhattan distance between the two sentences you've constructed (by hand!)

```{r message=FALSE}

```
